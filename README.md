# BME-FON-Lethryn

**BME-FON-Lethryn** is a learning-focused project within the **Before Month's End - Finished Or Not (BME-FON)** series.

This project follows a monthly, time-boxed format. Each BME-FON project begins on the **first day of the month** and concludes on the **last day of the month**, regardless of completion state.

For this iteration, the project runs from:

📅 **February 1, 2026 → February 28, 2026**

## Project Intent

This repository serves as an exploration of **how evolution emerges across different environments**.

The goal of this project is to experiment with how evolution occurs given specific environmental conditions and configurable parameters.

Rather than targeting a single polished or production-ready solution, the emphasis is on experimentation, iteration, and learning through implementation.

---

## Areas of Exploration

Areas planned during this project include:

- How plants expand and evolve within a given environment
- How herbivores expand and evolve based on plant availability
- How predators expand and evolve based on plant and herbivore populations
- How plants, herbivores, and predators interact to create the ecosystem
- How introducing monsters alters environments and evolutionary outcomes

While individual tasks or experiments may be completed, the overall depth and breadth of exploration may vary throughout the project window depending on time, focus, and findings.

## Scope & Flexibility

This project is intentionally exploratory.

The scope may shift throughout the month as new ideas, constraints, or opportunities are discovered. Some features may remain experimental or partially implemented as part of the learning process.

---

## BME-FON Philosophy

This project follows the **Finished Or Not** approach:

- Time-boxed learning  
- Progress over perfection  
- Iteration over abandonment  

The repository represents learning in motion rather than a finalized product.
