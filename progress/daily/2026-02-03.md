## Completions
- World Setup
    - Create basic world
    - Create different elevations on world
- Player
    - Created basic player to move around the world
    - Player can go up slopes

## Next Focus
- World Setup
    - Fix elevation throughout terrain.  Make fixed to mountains so they look better
    - Create water sources
- Player
    - Fix Rotation on slopes

## Notes
- While I do want to be able to save and load, that will be the first step next week where I can "save" a position and "load" it to continue the evolution given a new trait appears.
- MoveRotation is current function and I want to keep using that if I can.
- Not sure exactly how AnimationCurves work, so more research into them is needed.
- I spent a lot of time experimenting with terrains and getting the basic player movements to work.
- Might be better to get rid of the rigid body on the player and just have the player fly around
