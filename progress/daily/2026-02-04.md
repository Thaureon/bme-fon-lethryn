## Completions
- World Setup
    - Fixed some elevation throughout terrain.
    - Created basic water sources
- Player
    - Changed player from rigidbody to just movement.

## Next Focus
- World Setup
    - Fix mountains so they look better
    - Figure out how to defin water sources as water.
- Plants
    - Create first plant for world (trees)

## Notes
- Player clips through terrain, but I don't care
- Might want to look into a life cycle for all creatures
    - This includes plants
    - When plant is x "years" old it can spread
    - When plant is y "years" old it dies
- I need to figure out how to display each plant, do I want to do basic modeling and just scale it up as it gets "older" or something else.
- Messing with the terrain is interesting, but I need to focus on other things next.
- Probably want to get main way to get the height of the terrain at a specific point.
- All objects base position should be at the base of the model
