## Completions
- World Setup
    - Fixed water sources to be independent
    - Fixed 1 mountain as a test

## Next Focus
- Trees
    - Create Materials for Bark and Leaves
    - Create Script to add new tree and apply bark/leaves
    - Have script adjust different pieces of tree randomly.
- World Setup
    - Fix mountains so they look better
    - Figure out how to defin water sources as water.
- Plants
    - Create first plant for world (trees)

## Notes
- Terrain disappearing at a distance was the camera clipping planes.
- Default terrain height is 600, after increasing it to 2000, the first mountain feels a lot better.
    - This is also because I have experimented with the terrain adjusters recently.
- Tree is an object in Unity
    - Shape - Length: can help to show growth.
    - Shape - Radius: can help show age.
    - Other properties of Shape: helpful with variety
    - Group Seed: Can help with tree variety
    - Need to figure out how much of this I can edit with scripts
