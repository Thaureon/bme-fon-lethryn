## Completions
- Tree
    - Adjusted script to try to add dynamic trees.

## Next Focus
- Trees
    - Create Materials for Bark and Leaves
    - Create Script to add new tree and apply bark/leaves
    - Have script adjust different pieces of tree randomly.
- World Setup
    - Fix mountains so they look better
    - Figure out how to define water sources as water.
- Plants
    - Create first plant for world (bushes)

## Notes
- Adding dynamic trees is not possible with having a prefab of the tree.
- There may be a good way to handle it, but it will take a lot more work.
- Because trees are overly complex, I am going to switch to bushes and get those working first.
