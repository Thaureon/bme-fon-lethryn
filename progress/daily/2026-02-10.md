## Completions
- Plants
    - Created basic object to represent a bush
- Bush
    - Created way to create bush with predefined positioning
    - Added ability to create multiple bushes with ease
- Terrain
    - Got script mostly working for getting y at position

## Next Focus
- World Setup
    - Fix mountains so they look better
    - Figure out how to define water sources as water
- Bush
    - Make full area where the terrain can generate plants
    - Make sure bushes do not spawn below water
    - Create basic plant object that makes the plant grow until certain size

## Notes
- Removing Trees from Next Focus as they will be added later.
- Getting the terrain height at different positions was annoying to try and figure out since the documentation wasn't the best.
- Sometimes the terrain will place the object below the terrain even if the terrain is higher up.
